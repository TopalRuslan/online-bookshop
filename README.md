# 📚 Bookshop API

REST API for an online book store built with Django REST Framework.

## 🚦 Rate Limiting

All API endpoints are throttled to prevent abuse:

| Client | Limit |
|--------|-------|
| Anonymous (by IP) | 10 requests / minute |
| Authenticated (by user ID) | 60 requests / minute |

When the limit is exceeded the API returns `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After` header indicating how many seconds to wait.

To change the limits, edit `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES` in `proj/settings.py`.

## 📖 Books

- `GET /api/books/` — list all books
- `GET /api/books/{id}/` — get book details (includes genres, author, stock)
- `POST /api/books/` — create a book
- `PUT /api/books/{id}/` — replace a book
- `PATCH /api/books/{id}/` — partial update
- `DELETE /api/books/{id}/` — delete a book

## 👤 Authors

- `GET /api/authors/` — list all authors
- `GET /api/authors/{id}/` — get author details
- `POST /api/authors/` — create an author
- `PUT /api/authors/{id}/` — replace an author
- `PATCH /api/authors/{id}/` — partial update
- `DELETE /api/authors/{id}/` — delete an author

## 🏷️ Genres

- `GET /api/genres/` — list all genres
- `GET /api/genres/{id}/` — get genre details
- `POST /api/genres/` — create a genre `{ "name": "Роман" }`
- `PUT /api/genres/{id}/` — replace a genre
- `PATCH /api/genres/{id}/` — partial update
- `DELETE /api/genres/{id}/` — delete a genre

When creating or updating a book, pass genre IDs via `genre_ids`:
```json
{ "title": "Кобзар", "author_id": 3, "price": "150.00", "genre_ids": [1, 4, 7] }
```

## 📦 Orders

Requires authentication.

- `GET /api/orders/` — list current user's orders
- `GET /api/orders/{id}/` — get order details
- `POST /api/orders/` — create a new order
- `PUT /api/orders/{id}/` — update order status
- `DELETE /api/orders/{id}/` — cancel/delete order

## 🛒 Cart

Single endpoint, requires authentication. All actions use `/api/cart/`.

- `GET /api/cart/` — get current user's cart (items + `total_price`)
- `POST /api/cart/` — add item `{ "book_id": 1, "quantity": 1 }` → returns `{ total_items, total_price }`
- `PATCH /api/cart/` — update quantity `{ "item_id": 5, "quantity": 3 }` → returns `{ subtotal, total }`
- `DELETE /api/cart/` — remove item `{ "item_id": 5 }` → returns `{ total_items, total_price }`

## 🔧 Admin panel

Available at `/admin/`. Built with [django-unfold](https://github.com/unfoldadmin/django-unfold).

**Access levels:**
| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| Superuser | Full access to everything |
| Staff + group | Can edit models assigned to their group |
| Staff (no group) | Read-only |

**Groups** (create with `python manage.py create_groups`):
| Group | Models |
|-------|--------|
| Edit Books | Book, Author, Genre |
| Edit Orders | Order, OrderItem |
| Edit Users | User |

> Cart is read-only for everyone in the admin panel.

## 💻 Local development

**Requirements:** Python 3.12+

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-bookshop.git
cd online-bookshop
```

**2. Create and activate virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/macOS
source venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Create `.env`:**
```bash
cp env-sample .env
# fill in SECRET_KEY and Stripe keys
```

> `.env` is optional for a basic run. With none of the infra vars set the app
> uses SQLite, an in-process cache, the console email backend, and runs Celery
> tasks synchronously — **no PostgreSQL, Redis or Celery worker needed**. Those
> only come into play with Docker / Kubernetes, or if you set `DB_HOST` /
> `REDIS_URL` / `CELERY_BROKER_URL` yourself. Stripe checkout needs the keys.

> **Email confirmation** is required on registration. Locally, emails print to the console by default (`EMAIL_BACKEND=console`). The confirmation email template is at `templates/users/email_confirm.html`. To use real SMTP (e.g. Gmail), set these in `.env`:
> ```
> EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
> EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
> EMAIL_PORT=587
> EMAIL_USE_TLS=true
> EMAIL_HOST_USER=your@gmail.com
> EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password   # Google Account → Security → App passwords
> DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=BookShop <your@gmail.com>
> ```

**5. Apply migrations:**
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

**6. Create a superuser:**
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

**7. Create admin groups (once):**
```bash
python manage.py create_groups
```

**8. Seed the database (optional):**
```bash
python fixture.py
```

**9. Run the server:**
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:8000**

---

## 🚀 Deployment (EC2 or any Linux host)

**Requirements:** Ubuntu server, Docker, Docker Compose, open port 8000 in firewall/Security Group.

**1. Install Docker:**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose-plugin
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker
```

**2. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-bookshop.git
cd online-bookshop
```

**3. Create and fill `.env`:**
```bash
cp env-sample .env
nano .env
```

Set the following values:
```
SECRET_KEY=           # generate: python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
DEBUG=false
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=true
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=BookShop <your@gmail.com>
```

**4. Add your domain or IP to `.env`** (comma-separated, no spaces):
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,your-domain.com,your-ec2-ip,web
```
Defaults to `localhost,127.0.0.1,0.0.0.0,web` if unset. If you use [`deploy.sh`](deploy.sh) (see [Terraform](#🏗️-terraform-aws-infrastructure) section), this is set automatically.

**5. Build and start:**
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

The app will be available at **http://your-domain.com:8000**

**6. Create a superuser:**
```bash
docker exec -it online-bookshop-web-1 python manage.py createsuperuser
```

**7. Create admin groups (once):**
```bash
docker exec online-bookshop-web-1 python manage.py create_groups
```

**8. Seed the database (optional):**
```bash
docker exec online-bookshop-web-1 python fixture.py
```

**Useful commands:**
```bash
docker compose logs -f          # view logs
docker compose down             # stop (data preserved)
docker compose down -v          # stop and delete all data
docker compose up -d            # start after server reboot
```

## 🌐 Nginx (reverse proxy)

The file [`nginx.conf`](nginx.conf) is included in the repository and gets copied to the server automatically on every deploy.

**What it does:**
- Proxies all requests to Django (port 8000)
- Serves static files directly from `/opt/online-bookshop/staticfiles/`
- Serves media files directly from `/opt/online-bookshop/media/` (only when S3 is not used)

**One-time setup on the server (first deploy only):**
```bash
# Copy config and enable site
sudo cp /opt/online-bookshop/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/bookshop
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/bookshop /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/bookshop
sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

# Test and reload
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

After the first setup, nginx config is updated automatically on every deploy via CI/CD.

**To use a domain instead of IP**, replace `server_name _;` in `nginx.conf` with your domain:
```nginx
server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;
```

## ☁️ AWS S3 (media storage)

Used for storing book cover images in production. Without S3, images are stored locally in `media/`.

**If provisioned via [Terraform](#🏗️-terraform-aws-infrastructure)** — the bucket, public read policy, and an IAM instance role are created automatically. Just add to `.env` on the server:
```
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=online-bookshop-media
AWS_S3_REGION_NAME=us-east-1
```
No access keys needed — the EC2 instance's IAM role grants it S3 access.

**Manual setup (no Terraform):**
1. Create an S3 bucket (e.g. `online-bookshop-media`)
2. In bucket **Permissions → Block public access** — disable all blocks
3. Add **Bucket policy** for public read:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": "*",
    "Action": "s3:GetObject",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
  }]
}
```
4. Create an IAM user with `AmazonS3FullAccess`, generate Access Key
5. Add to `.env`:
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=online-bookshop-media
AWS_S3_REGION_NAME=us-east-1
```

When `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME` is set, Django automatically uses S3 for all media uploads (with explicit keys if present, otherwise the instance's IAM role).

---

## 🏗️ Terraform (AWS infrastructure)

Provisions the app's infrastructure: [`main.tf`](main.tf) creates a security group (ports 22, 80, 9090, 3000), generates an SSH key pair, launches an Ubuntu 24.04 `t3.small` instance with a static Elastic IP and an IAM instance role (S3 read/write on the media bucket, no access keys needed on the server), and creates the S3 bucket itself (public read policy, matching the manual setup described [above](#☁️-aws-s3-media-storage)).

The instance installs Docker and Docker Compose automatically on boot via `user_data` — no manual SSH setup needed before deploying. The S3 bucket has `prevent_destroy` set, so a stray `terraform destroy` won't wipe uploaded book covers (destroy it manually in the AWS console if you really need to).

**Install Terraform:**
```bash
# Windows (winget)
winget install HashiCorp.Terraform

# Windows (choco)
choco install terraform

# macOS
brew install terraform

# Linux
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y terraform
```

Check it installed correctly:
```bash
terraform -version
```

**Setup:**
1. Create an IAM user in AWS with `AmazonEC2FullAccess`, `AmazonS3FullAccess`, and `IAMFullAccess` (needed to create the instance role), generate an Access Key (use case: **Command Line Interface (CLI)**)
2. Copy the example vars file and fill in your keys:
```bash
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```
`terraform.tfvars` ([example here](terraform.tfvars.example)) is already gitignored — your keys never get committed.

**Usage:**
```bash
terraform init    # downloads providers (aws, tls, local)
terraform plan     # preview what will be created — review before applying
terraform apply    # create the resources
```

The S3 bucket name gets a random suffix appended (`bucket_name` + random hex, e.g. `online-bookshop-media-a1b2c3d4`) since S3 bucket names must be globally unique across **all** AWS accounts, not just yours.

After `apply`, Terraform outputs the instance's public (Elastic) IP, its private IP, the actual S3 bucket name (`s3_bucket_name`), and the path to the generated `.pem` private key (used to SSH into the box and, later, as the `EC2_SSH_KEY` GitHub secret). Copy the `s3_bucket_name` output into `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME` in `.env` on the server.

To tear everything down:
```bash
terraform destroy
```

### 🚢 Deploying with `deploy.sh`

[`deploy.sh`](deploy.sh) automates everything after `terraform apply` except the secrets, which only you can provide.

**What it does, in order:**
1. Figures out the S3 bucket name — reads it from `~/.bookshop-bucket-name` (written automatically by terraform's `user_data` when the instance was created), or from an explicit `./deploy.sh <bucket-name>` argument if you pass one (needed only if that file is missing, e.g. an older instance)
2. If `.env` doesn't exist yet — creates it from `env-sample` and stops, asking you to fill in secrets first
3. Checks that `SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` are present in `.env` **and** aren't still the `env-sample` placeholders — if anything's missing or unfilled, it lists what and stops (nothing gets deployed)
4. Once all of those are filled in, it detects the instance's public IP via EC2 instance metadata, and writes/overwrites `DEBUG=false`, `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`, `AWS_S3_REGION_NAME`, and `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `.env` — these four are always kept in sync with the current environment, unlike the secrets
5. Runs `docker compose up --build -d`
6. Runs `collectstatic` inside the running container — needed because `staticfiles/` is bind-mounted from the host, which shadows whatever `collectstatic` produced inside the image at build time
7. Installs nginx if missing, copies `nginx.conf`, enables the site, reloads nginx

**First deploy onto a fresh instance:**
```bash
ssh -i bookshop-key.pem ubuntu@<instance_public_ip>
git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-bookshop.git
cd online-bookshop
cp env-sample .env && nano .env   # fill in SECRET_KEY, Stripe keys, email settings — one-time only
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

**Redeploying later** (after a `git pull` with new code) — same command, safe to re-run:
```bash
git pull
./deploy.sh
```

Your filled-in secrets in `.env` are never touched on subsequent runs — only the four environment-specific fields get refreshed.

## 🟢 Celery (background tasks)

Used for sending confirmation emails asynchronously so the user gets an instant response after registration without waiting for SMTP.

**How it works:**
1. User registers → Django puts a task in the Redis queue (database `2`) and immediately returns a response
2. Celery worker picks up the task and sends the email in the background

Celery worker runs as a separate Docker service and starts automatically with `docker compose up`. Without `CELERY_BROKER_URL` set (a bare local `runserver`) tasks run synchronously in-process instead — no worker or Redis required.

**To view worker logs:**
```bash
docker compose logs -f celery
```

**To inspect queued tasks:**
```bash
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -n 2 KEYS "*"
```

**Email template** — edit the confirmation email at:
```
templates/users/email_confirm.html
```

---

## 🔴 Redis (caching)

Used for caching genre and author list responses. Reduces DB load on every page load.

- Genres (`/api/genres/`) and authors are cached for **5 minutes**
- Cache is automatically invalidated on create/update/delete
- Redis runs as a separate Docker service (database `1`)

Redis is included in `docker-compose.yml` and starts automatically with `docker compose up`. No additional setup required. On a bare local `runserver` (no `REDIS_URL`) the cache falls back to in-process memory — Redis is not needed.

**To inspect cached keys:**
```bash
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -n 1 KEYS "*"
```

---

## 📋 Logging

Errors and key business events are logged to stdout and collected by Docker.

**What is logged:**
| Event | Level |
|-------|-------|
| User registered | INFO |
| Email confirmation sent / failed | INFO / ERROR |
| Email confirmed | INFO |
| Order paid via Stripe | INFO |
| Stripe webhook invalid signature | ERROR |
| Django 500 errors | ERROR |

**View logs in real time:**
```bash
docker compose logs -f web     # Django logs
docker compose logs -f celery  # Celery task logs
```

**Log rotation** is configured automatically — max 10 MB per file, last 3 files kept (30 MB total per service). No manual cleanup needed.

**To clear logs manually if needed:**
```bash
truncate -s 0 $(docker inspect --format='{{.LogPath}}' online-bookshop-web-1)
```

## 📊 Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)

Prometheus scrapes Django metrics every 15s. Grafana visualises them.

![Grafana dashboard](static/Grafana_preview.png)

**Access:**
| Service | URL | Credentials |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Prometheus | `http://your-ip:9090` | — |
| Grafana | `http://your-ip:3000` | admin / admin |

> **First login:** Grafana will ask you to change the admin password. Do it.

**Dashboard panels (auto-loaded on first start):**
| Panel | What it shows |
|-------|---------------|
| HTTP Request Rate | Requests/s broken down by status code (2xx, 4xx, 5xx) |
| Request Latency | Response time p50 and p95 in seconds |
| DB Queries/s | SQL queries per second (django-prometheus) |
| Redis Cache Hit Rate | Cache hit percentage (genres / authors caching) |

**Port setup on EC2** — open ports 9090 and 3000 in AWS Security Group (Inbound rules → Custom TCP).

**Metrics endpoint** is exposed at `/metrics` by `django-prometheus`. Prometheus scrapes it internally via `web:8000` (Docker network). You don't need port 9090 open for scraping to work — only for browser access to the Prometheus UI.

**Host metrics** (CPU, RAM, Disk) are collected by Node Exporter running as a separate Docker service.

**Email alerting** — Grafana sends an email notification when any of the following conditions occur:

| Alert | Condition | Severity |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| CPU Usage > 90% | Sustained for 2 min | warning |
| RAM Usage > 85% | Sustained for 2 min | warning |
| Disk Usage > 80% | Sustained for 5 min | warning |
| Django Service Down | No response for 1 min | critical |

Alerts repeat every **4 hours** while the problem persists. SMTP settings are taken from `.env` automatically — no extra config needed if email confirmation is already configured.

To change thresholds or recipient address, edit `grafana/provisioning/alerting/rules.yml` and `contact-points.yml`.

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

The workflow file is located at [`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`](.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml).

**How it works:**
- Every push or PR to `main` → runs the test suite with coverage check (min 80%)
- Every push to `main` (after tests pass) → automatically deploys to EC2 via SSH

**Required GitHub Secrets** (`Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`):

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Django secret key |
| `EC2_HOST` | EC2 public IP address |
| `EC2_USER` | SSH user on the server (e.g. `ubuntu`) |
| `EC2_SSH_KEY` | Private SSH key for connecting to EC2 |

**Setting up the SSH key on the server:**
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions" -f ~/.ssh/github_actions -N ""
cat ~/.ssh/github_actions.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
cat ~/.ssh/github_actions   # copy this into EC2_SSH_KEY secret
```

**To change the coverage threshold**, edit the `--cov-fail-under` flag in `ci-cd.yml`:
```yaml
run: pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80
```

---

## 💳 Stripe (test payments)

Uses Stripe Sandbox for local development.

**Setup `.env`:**
```
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_...   # Publishable key from Stripe Dashboard → Developers → API keys
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...   # Secret key from Stripe Dashboard → Developers → API keys
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... # Generated by stripe listen (see below)
```

**Start webhook listener:**
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/orders/webhook/
```

The command prints:
```
> Ready! Your webhook signing secret is whsec_abc123...
```
Copy `whsec_abc123...` into `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env`, then restart the Django server. Keep this terminal open while testing.

**Test card:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Card number | `4242 4242 4242 4242` |
| Expiry | any future date, e.g. `12/34` |
| CVC | any 3 digits, e.g. `123` |
| Name | anything |

After payment the order status changes from `pending` → `paid` via webhook.
